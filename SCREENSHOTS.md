2. Show the expanded notification form with:
   - Desktop/Mobile text fields
   - Primary and secondary button fields
   - Color pickers visible
   - The form should look professional and clear

### Screenshot 3: Position and Display Rules

2. Capture showing:
   - Position radio buttons (Top/Bottom)
   - Show On dropdown menu
   - Hide for logged-in users checkbox
   - Schedule date fields

### Screenshot 4: Bottom Notification Bar (Frontend)
1. Set up a notification with position = "bottom"
2. Use an attractive message (e.g., "FREE Plugin This Month: BuddyPress Activity Social Share")
3. Include both primary button and secondary link
